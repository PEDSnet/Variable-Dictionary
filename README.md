# PRESERVE VARIABLE DICTIONARY
# Under Development

### The repository of variable definitions and codesets for the PCORI-funded PRESERVE study.

#### The repository contains sections for both variable definitions and codesets used for the PRESERVE study. The repository functions as a single centralized location for codeset and variable definition information across the PRESERVE study, as updates and refinements are made.
#### A codeset is a collection of codes (e.g., diagnosis or procedure codes) which are used for a given clinical concept. A variable definition specifies the logic for determining (levels of) a variable from the data. A variable definition may include one or more codesets (e.g., a patient is identified as having a condition if they have >=2 diagnosis codes separated by >= 90 days). A computable phenotype is an algorithm that includes more >1 variable in order to assess a healthcare concept.
