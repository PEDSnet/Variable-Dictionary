# PEDSnet VARIABLE DICTIONARY
# Under Development

### The repository for variable definitions and codesets for PEDSnet studies.

#### This repository contains includes variable definitions and codesets that have been developed for PEDSnet studies. The repository functions as a single centralized location for codeset and variable definition information as updates and refinements are made.
#### In this repository, a codeset refers to a collection of codes (e.g., diagnosis or procedure codes) which are used for a given clinical concept, whereas a variable definition refers to the logic for determining (levels of) a variable. A variable definition may include one or more codesets. The term "computable phenotype" is sometimes used for a complex variable definition which uses multiple other variables to assess or determine a healthcare concept.
